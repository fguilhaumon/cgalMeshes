# cgalMeshes 1.1.0

It is now possible to assign colors and scalars to the faces or the vertices of a mesh. These properties are preserved by certain operations. For example, the computation of the connected components preserve all properties. The normals are also assigned to the mesh as a property, and they are preserved when computing the connected components.

Description: Provides some utilities for 3D meshes: clipping of a mesh to
    the volume bounded by another mesh, decomposition into convex parts,
    distance between a mesh and a point, Hausdorff distance between two
    meshes, triangulation, geodesic distance, Boolean operations
    (intersection, union, difference), Minkowski sum, subdivision
    algorithms, random sampling on a mesh, volume, area, and centroid.
    Also provides two algorithms for surface reconstruction from a cloud
    of points. Meshes are represented by R6 classes. All algorithms are
    performed by the 'C++' library 'CGAL' (<https://www.cgal.org/>).

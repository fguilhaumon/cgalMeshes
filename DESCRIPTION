Description: Provides some utilities for 3D meshes: clipping of a mesh to
    the volume bounded by another mesh, decomposition into convex parts,
    distance between a mesh and a point, triangulation, geodesic distance,
    Boolean operations (intersection, union, difference), connected
    components, volume, area, and centroid. Also provides an algorithm for
    surface reconstruction from a cloud of points. Meshes are represented
    by R6 classes. All algorithms are performed by the 'C++' library
    'CGAL' (<https://www.cgal.org/>).
